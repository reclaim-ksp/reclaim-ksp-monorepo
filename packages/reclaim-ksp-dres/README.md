# Reclaim KSP - Dres

This mod ~~replaces~~ adds Dres, the urban legend referenced in KSP memes, based on testimony from the victims of the mass hallucination called "KSP 2".

## Features
### Rings
As seen in the collective hallucination that was KSP 2!
### Asteroids
Spawning in the range of the ring, because that makes sense!
> NOTE: The default asteroid band further out from the ring is NOT affected - if you know how to remove it, contact us by creating an issue or PR in this repo
### Terrain rework
Better surface features!

Colors adjusted to not be boring, nor look like it's oversaturated / has jaundice, to fit with the rest of KSP!

## Contribution
There are a few desired changes:
- removing the default asteroid belt
- adjusting Parallax surface features to match the new color scheme of the terrain

If you know anything about tackling these, contributions are welcome.

Questions and discussions are welcome, feel free to hop on [Danny's Discord](https://discord.gg/Xr9eHaHau2) to ask them!
