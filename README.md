## Installation:

1. TODO
2. Pick `Scatterer Sunflare` (TODO: can this be automated?)
3. CKAN will now download about ~6 GB of data

## Looking to add:
- windowed fullscreen / borderless window
- dynamic music like in KSP 2 (but probably not the same as KSP 2 due to legalities?)

## Q&A:

- Q: Why is it called Reclaim KSP?
- A: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è had to pick a name, my Discord seemed to be on board with it. The word came to mind because after T2 murdered the franchise it felt like the community reclaimed KSP 1 with mods as the definitive edition of the game, and I alluded to this in my last KSP 2 video too.

- Q: What's the point?
- A: To make a new "definitive starting point" for the laypeople, who want a one-click upgrade to their KSP! Buy the game, install this, and you are all caught up! No analysis-paralysis as to what mods to start with!

- Q: What was the criteria when picking mods?
- A: I picked mods that bring in KSP 2 improvements (warp while burning), ones that add meaningful visual or gameplay fidelity (intra vehicular movement, simple and forgiving life support, visual upgrades, etc), without becoming hardcore or too bloated. Only added enough parts to make it fresh, only added features that are fun.

- Q: Why is XY mod not in it?
- A: Because of my subjective taste! However, I tried to pick mods that allow further additions without too much conflict.

- Q: What next?
- A: If this gets enough traction, I wish to attract people who want to bring further improvements over from KSP 2. Missing water-based science, and the story of KSP 2 would be lovely.
